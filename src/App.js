     <p>To win, a majority of the total ten cards played (including the one card that is not placed on the board)
      must be of the player's card color. To do this, the player must capture cards by placing a card adjacent to an
       opponent's card whereupon the 'ranks' of the sides where the two cards touch will be compared. If the rank of
        the opponent's card is higher than the player's card, the player's card will be captured and turned into the
         opponent's color. If the player's rank is higher, the opponent's card will be captured and changed into the
          player's color instead.
